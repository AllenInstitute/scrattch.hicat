\title{Doublet detection in single-cell RNA sequencing data}
\usage{
doubletFinder(data, select.genes, proportion.artificial = 0.2,
  k = pmin(100, ncol(data) * 0.01))
}
\arguments{
\item{seu}{A fully-processed Seurat object (i.e. after normalization, variable gene definition,
scaling, PCA, and tSNE).}

\item{expected.doublets}{The number of doublets expected to be present in the original data.
This value can best be estimated from cell loading densities into the 10X/Drop-Seq device.}

\item{porportion.artificial}{The proportion (from 0-1) of the merged real-artificial dataset
that is artificial. In other words, this argument defines the total number of artificial doublets.
Default is set to 25%, based on optimization on PBMCs (see McGinnis, Murrow and Gartner 2018, BioRxiv).}

\item{proportion.NN}{The proportion (from 0-1) of the merged real-artificial dataset used to define
each cell's neighborhood in PC space. Default set to 1%, based on optimization on PBMCs (see McGinnis,
Murrow and Gartner 2018, BioRxiv).}
}
\value{
An updated Seurat object with metadata for pANN values and doublet predictions.
}
\description{
This function generaetes artificial nearest neighbors from existing single-cell RNA
sequencing data. First, real and artificial data are merged. Second, dimension reduction
is performed on the merged real-artificial dataset using PCA. Third, the proportion of
artificial nearest neighbors is defined for each real cell. Finally, real cells are rank-
ordered and predicted doublets are defined via thresholding based on the expected number
of doublets.
